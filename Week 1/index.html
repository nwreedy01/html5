        <p>I enjoy reading in my free time. Other than that, a lot of my time is also spent with my girlfriend and pet dog. We recently moved to the fox valley area and are still getting settled. I also enjoy playing and watching soccer. </p>
        <p>In this course, I am hoping to learn the basics needed to help build websites. I also hope that it will improve my coding abilities which I hope to make my career one day. I am hoping that my instructor will be helpful with all my questions that I will have. I also hope to recieve a lot of good advice from someone who has worked in the field that I am hoping to enter in to.</p>
